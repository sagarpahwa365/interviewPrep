Sales Rank
Here’s a brief reminder of the recommended interview structure:

Establish the feature scope and constraints
Describe high-level architecture
Drill Down: design and scale core components
Scaling the design
Tradeoffs and future improvements
Make sure to focus on the most challenging aspects of this specific question, and not spend too much time on trivial issues. Some questions have a more challenging API design, while other questions are worth focusing on the load and network architecture.

There’s no single correct answer to a real-world problem; everything is a trade-off. Your goal as an interviewer is to understand how the candidate makes decisions, rather than getting them to focus on one subject or come to a particular conclusion.

Remember that system design interview questions are open ended by nature, so make sure to choose a specific subset of the system you feel most comfortable with, to drill down with your peer as an interviewer.
